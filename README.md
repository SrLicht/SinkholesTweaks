# SinkholesTweaks
 A NWAPI plugin that allows you to slightly change how SinkHoles work in SCP:SL


 # Installation
 You can install this using the command ``p install SrLicht/SinkholesTweaks`` from the console or by downloading the ``SinkholesTweaks.dll`` and put it in the plugins folder, also make sure you have ``0Harmony.dll`` in the dependencies folder.

 # Sinking players
 This plugin has a function that makes the players that are sunk by a Sinkhole to be seen in this way, it is disabled by default because to make a player go through the ground I have to give him NoClip and I only give it for 0.5 seconds but it is still disabled by default.
